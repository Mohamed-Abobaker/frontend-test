Konfir Frontend Test
===

# Instructions

- The aim is to create a responsive table similar to the screenshot in this repo: verifications.png
- We value your time. Take only an hour to complete the test. 
- We know you can't complete all in one hour. We're looking to see what you will prioritise.

Below is a list of ideas for features (in no particular order) you can work on:
- (Must have) Display table with all information
- Page header (title, switcher, user dropdown)
- CSS styling
- Responsive table
- Sort (any column)
- Pagination
- Search by Employee Name
- Search by Verifier Name

## Additional terms
- We love tests. There is a file ready for you to use (`page.test.tsx`).
- You may of course use any resources you like to assist you with specific techniques, syntax etc - but please do not just copy code.
- Please don't share this exercise with anyone else :)


## Getting started:

- Clone this repository
- Run `yarn install` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn dev` or `npm dev`
- Go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the basic hello world app
- Work from the `./src` folder in this directory
- You can run tests with Jest: `yarn test` or `npm test`
